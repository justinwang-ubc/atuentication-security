# Whisper Web App built with authentication
this is my demo authentication and security web app. the web app can let people sign up/in with their google account or create a local account and submit their anonymous secrets.

I experiment with differnet level security.
1. level 1: register users with username and password. password are plain text stored in DB.
2. level 2: database encryption 
3. level 3: hashing passwords 
4. level 4: salting and hashing passwords with bcrypt 
5. level 5: using passport.js to add cookies and sessions 
6. level 6: OAuth 2.0 & implement sign in with google
